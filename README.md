# Enron Email Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Enron Email Analysis assignment in the ISYS2001 Introduction to Business Programming course. The goal of this assignment is to analyze the Enron Mail dataset, a collection of email communications from Enron executives, employees, and other associates, in order to gain insights into the company's communication patterns and uncover potential topics of interest.

#Notebooks as Business Reports

Python notebooks, such as Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab, are utilized as powerful tools for creating business reports, particularly when working with data-driven projects. The advantage of using notebooks for business reports lies in their ability to blend code, visualizations, and narrative text within a single, interactive document. This approach allows for a seamless integration of data analysis, interpretation, and communication, facilitating the presentation of insights and findings in a coherent and accessible manner.

Additionally, Python notebooks promote collaboration and reproducibility in the context of business reporting. Team members can easily share their work, enabling others to review, contribute, or modify the content. This collaborative environment harnesses the collective expertise of teams, leading to more robust and insightful analyses. Moreover, by including the data processing, analysis, and visualization code within the same document, Python notebooks ensure that the results can be easily replicated and validated by others. This transparency and reproducibility enhance the credibility of the business report and allow for efficient updates and adaptations as new data or requirements emerge.

#Purpose of the Repository

The purpose of this repository is to provide the code and analysis for the Enron Email Analysis assignment. The main components of the repository include:

1. `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the assignment, describes the purpose of the repository, and outlines the tasks and objectives of the assignment.

2. `Business_Report_Notebook.ipynb`: This notebook serves as the main business report and contains the code, analysis, and discussion of the Enron Email dataset. It runs on a Google Colab instance and requires no additional steps other than running the code cells within the notebook.

3. `Development_Notebook.ipynb`: This notebook complements the business report notebook and includes pseudocode, testing, and any other industry best practices that may not be observable from the business report itself.

4. `enron_database.sqlite`: This SQLite database file contains the Enron Email dataset and is utilized for data extraction and analysis in the notebooks.

5. `data/`: This directory contains any additional data files or resources that may be required for the analysis.
